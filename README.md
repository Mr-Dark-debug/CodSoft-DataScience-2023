# CodSoft-DataScience-2023
Welcome to my repository showcasing my data science skills and projects completed during my internship at CodeSoft.

Here, you will find three projects:

1. Titanic Survival Detection: This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory
data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python: In this project, I developed a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data
collection, preprocessing, and the creation of a machine-learning model to predict movie ratings.

3. Iris Flower Classification: This project is a classic machine learning task that involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into
different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.


Thank you for taking the time to explore my data science skills and projects completed during my internship at CodeSoft. I hope you found
them informative and insightful. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Have a great day!
